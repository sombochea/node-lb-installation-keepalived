# Node LB Installation

```shell
sudo apt-get install keepalived
```

- Node1: Create or edit file: `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`

```conf
global_defs {
   notification_email {
     sysadmin@cubetiqhost.net
     support@cubetiqhost.net
   }
   notification_email_from lb-node1@cubetiqhost.net
   smtp_server localhost
   smtp_connect_timeout 30
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface ens18
    virtual_router_id 101
    priority 101
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 1111
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.0.60
    }
}
```

- Node1: Create or edit file: `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`

```confg
global_defs {
   notification_email {
     sysadmin@cubetiqhost.net
     support@cubetiqhost.net
   }
   notification_email_from lb-node2@cubetiqhost.net
   smtp_server localhost
   smtp_connect_timeout 30
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state BACKUP
    interface ens18
    virtual_router_id 101
    priority 100
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass cubetiq007
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.0.60
    }
}
```

- Restart keepalived service

```shell
sudo service keepalived start
```

- Show virtual ip address on lb-node2
```shell
ip -a
```

- Notes
1. Priority value will be higher on Master server, It doesnâ€™t matter what you used in state. If your state is MASTER but your priority is lower than the router with BACKUP, you will lose the MASTER state.
2. virtual_router_id should be same on both LB1 and LB2 servers.
3. By default single vrrp_instance support up to 20 virtual_ipaddress. In order to add more addresses you need to add more vrrp_instance

### Setup 3 masters keepalived
- master-1 `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`
```config
global_defs {
   notification_email {
     sysadmin@cubetiqhost.net
     support@cubetiqhost.net
   }
   notification_email_from master-1@cubetiqhost.net
   smtp_server localhost
   smtp_connect_timeout 30
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface ens18
    virtual_router_id 101
    priority 101
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 1111
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.0.60
    }
}
```

- master-2 (BACKUP) `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`
```config
global_defs {
   notification_email {
     sysadmin@cubetiqhost.net
     support@cubetiqhost.net
   }
   notification_email_from master-2@cubetiqhost.net
   smtp_server localhost
   smtp_connect_timeout 30
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state BACKUP
    interface ens18
    virtual_router_id 101
    priority 100
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 1111
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.0.60
    }
}
```

- master-3 (BACKUP) `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`
```config
global_defs {
   notification_email {
     sysadmin@cubetiqhost.net
     support@cubetiqhost.net
   }
   notification_email_from master-3@cubetiqhost.net
   smtp_server localhost
   smtp_connect_timeout 30
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state BACKUP
    interface ens18
    virtual_router_id 101
    priority 100
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 1111
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.0.60
